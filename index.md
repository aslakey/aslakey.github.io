Hi, I'm Austin. I am currently a lead scientist on Generative AI projects at Netflix. Previously, I worked in Content Demand Modeling to predict the success of titles on the platform and identify their target audiences. Before that, I developed recommendation algorithms for Apple Music, TV, Arcade, and the App Store. This blog is where I document my learnings and projects.
